/// @notice Abstract — emergency settlement paths extracted for bytecode headroom.
///         Inherited by SyndicateGovernor alongside GovernorParameters.
///
///         Implements the Task 24 guardian review lifecycle:
///           - `unstick`: vault owner rescues a proposal stuck in Executed state by
///             running its pre-committed settlement calls (no guardian review — the
///             calls were already governance-approved).
///           - `emergencySettleWithCalls`: vault owner proposes owner-supplied
///             settlement calls. Requires active owner bond. Opens a guardian review.
///           - `cancelEmergencySettle`: vault owner withdraws their review before
///             finalization.
///           - `finalizeEmergencySettle`: once the review period has elapsed and the
///             block quorum was not reached, the owner runs the reviewed calls.
///
///         The legacy single-entrypoint `emergencySettle(uint256, Call[])` was
///         fully removed in PR #229 (from both the interface and this abstract)
///         as part of the guardian-review narrowing.
